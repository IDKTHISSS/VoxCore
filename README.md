# VoxCore Game Engine

**VoxCore Game Engine** is a work-in-progress 3D voxel-based game engine built using **Vulkan**, **SDL3**, and **ImGui**. It is designed to be modular, lightweight, and highly extensible for voxel-style games and simulations.

> ⚠️ This engine is currently under active development. Many features are incomplete or experimental. Breaking changes are expected.

## Features (WIP)
- 🧱 Custom voxel renderer powered by Vulkan
- 🖥️ Integrated ImGui-based UI system
- 📦 ECS-style architecture for game logic
- 🚀 Flexible graphics pipeline system for rendering customization
- 🔧 Planned support for scripting, world generation, physics, and more...

## Tech Stack
- [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) – low-level graphics API
- [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) – cross-platform window and input handling
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) – immediate mode GUI for debugging and tools
- C++17 (transitioning to C++20)
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) – math library for graphics and transformations
